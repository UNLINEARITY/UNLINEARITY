## Hi there 👋 I'm UNLINEARITY!

I'm a Control Engineering student at China University of Petroleum. I’m passionate about **mathematics**, **control theory**, **computer science**, **machine learning**, and **systems science** — anything that helps make complex things understandable and beautiful. 🚀

### 🔍 What I'm working on
Currently, I'm building a knowledge base designed to present information through **bidirectional links** and **relational graphs**. The goal is to make learning more intuitive, interconnected, and nonlinear — just like how knowledge really works.

You can explore the project here:
