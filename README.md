👋 Hi, I’m UNLINEARITY , a student majoring in Control Engineering in China University of Petroleum

I have a keen interest in mathematics, control theory, computer science, machine learning, systems science and so on......

Recently, I have been working on building a knowledge base that primarily presents information through bidirectional links and relational graphs. 

If you are interested in my project, you can visit this [repository](https://github.com/UNLINEARITY/Learn-for-Everything) or [wedsite](https://www.unlinearity.top/) to have a look.
