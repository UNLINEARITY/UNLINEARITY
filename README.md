HiðŸ‘‹ , Iâ€™m UNLINEARITY , a student majoring in Control Engineering in China University of Petroleum

I have a keen interest in **mathematics**,**control theory**, **computer science**, **machine learning**, **systems science** and so on......ðŸš€

Recently, I have been working on building a knowledge base that primarily presents information through bidirectional links and relational graphs. 

If you are interested in my project, you can visit this [repository](https://github.com/UNLINEARITY/Learn-for-Everything) or [wedsite](https://www.unlinearity.top/) to have a look.

(However, due to time and capability constraints, the website currently only supports display in Chinese.)

If you are interested, you are welcome to contact me at any time, or even join in to contribute to this project together.ðŸ’•
